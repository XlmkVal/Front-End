...something - spread operator, will pass array to each argument if 
	alone, or an array to argument
shallow copy - copied by reference, so altering one will alter the other
deep copy - won't let you alter both with single call 


###07.02.2017 Inheritance

classes can be anonymous in JS
there is no overloading in JS, as there is no fix number of arguments

class sommething {
	// there are get and set methods in JS
	constructor(){
		
	}
	methods names{
		
	}
}

class other extends something {
	// should invoke super constructor in the base class constr. when 
	// override
	constructor(something){
		super(something);
		other new things
	}
}

super() - refer the base class we inherit
	super.<name of method from the base class> - class in the child class
		a method from the parent
